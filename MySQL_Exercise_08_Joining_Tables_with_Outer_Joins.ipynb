    "## Left and Right Joins\n",
    "\n",
    "Left and right joins use a different sytax than we used in the lesson about inner joins.  The method I showed you to execute inner joins tells the database how to relate tables in a WHERE clause like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```mySQL\n",
    "WHERE d.dog_guid=r.dog_guid\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "I find this syntax -- called the \"equijoin\" syntax -- to be very intuitive, so I thought it would be a good idea to start with it.  However, we can re-write the inner joins in the same syntax used by outer joins.  To use this more traditional syntax, you have to tell the database how to connect the tables using an ON clause that comes right after the FROM clause.  Make sure to specify the word \"JOIN\" explicitly.  This traditional version of the syntax frees up the WHERE clause for other things you might want to include in your query.  Here's what one of our queries from the inner join lesson would look like using the traditional syntax:\n",
    "\n",
    "```mySQL\n",
    "SELECT d.dog_guid AS DogID, d.user_guid AS UserID, AVG(r.rating) AS AvgRating, COUNT(r.rating) AS NumRatings, d.breed, d.breed_group, d.breed_type\n",
    "FROM dogs d JOIN reviews r\n",
    "  ON d.dog_guid=r.dog_guid AND d.user_guid=r.user_guid\n",
    "GROUP BY d.user_guid\n",
    "HAVING NumRatings > 9\n",
    "ORDER BY AvgRating DESC\n",
    "LIMIT 200\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You could also write \"INNER JOIN\" instead of \"JOIN\" but the default in MySQL is that JOIN will mean inner join, so including the word \"INNER\" is optional.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you need a WHERE clause in the query above, it would go after the ON clause and before the GROUP BY clause.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example of a different query we used in the last lesson that employed the equijoin syntax:\n",
    "\n",
    "```mySQL\n",
    "SELECT d.user_guid AS UserID, d.dog_guid AS DogID, \n",
    "       d.breed, d.breed_type, d.breed_group\n",
    "FROM dogs d, complete_tests c\n",
    "WHERE d.dog_guid=c.dog_guid AND test_name='Yawn Warm-up';\n",
    "```\n",
