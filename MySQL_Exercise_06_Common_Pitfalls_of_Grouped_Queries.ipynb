In fact, the visualization software Tableau (which is based in SQL language) recognized how frequently this type of situation arises and came up with a custom solution for its customers.  Tableau incorprated an aggregation-like function called \"ATTR\" into its interface to let users say \"I'm using an aggregation function here because SQL says I have to, but I know that this is a situation where all of the rows in each group will have the same value.\"  \n",

MySQL doesn't force users to do this.  MySQL trusts users to know what they are doing, and will provide an output even if all the rows in a group do not have the same value.
